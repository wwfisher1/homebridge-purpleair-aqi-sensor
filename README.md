# Homebridge-purpleair-multisensor
[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/homebridge-airly.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-airly)

**Homebridge plugin that is showing information about air quality from PurpleAir API.**

Project is based on [homebridge-weather](https://github.com/werthdavid/homebridge-weather), [homebridge-arinow](https://github.com/ToddGreenfield/homebridge-airnow), [SANdood's homebridge-purpleair](https://github.com/SANdood/homebridge-purpleair), and [aanon4's homebridge-purpleair](https://github.com/aanon4/homebridge-purpleair).

This plugin supports Air Quality, PM2.5, Temperature and Humidity.

## Installation
1. Install Homebridge using: `(sudo) npm install -g --unsafe-perm homebridge`.
2. Install this plugin via [homebridge-config-ui-x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-config-ui-x)

- or -

1. Install Homebridge using: `(sudo) npm install -g --unsafe-perm homebridge`.
2. Install this plugin manually:
    1. find the directory that `homebridge` was installed in (e.g. `/usr/local/lib/node-modules`)
    2. create `homebridge-purpleair-multisensor` in that directory
    3. copy `index.js` and `package.js` into this directory
    4. make sure the file/directory ownership and RWX permissions are the same as other modules in that directory
3. Update your `homebridge` configuration file like the example below.


## Configuration
Example config.json

```json
"accessories": [
    {
          "accessory": "PurpleAir",
          "purpleID": "nnnnn",
          "localIP": "192.168.1.xxx",
          "updateFreq": 90,
          "name": "PurpleAir Air Quality",
          "statsKey": "v1",
          "adjust": "NONE",
          "includePM10": false,
          "verboseLogging": false,
          "adjustTempF": "-8",
          "adjustHum": "4"
    }
]
```

## Config file
Fields:
- `accessory` must be "PurpleAir" (required).
- `purpleID` PurpleAir Station ID (a number); required but ignored if localIP is also specified.
- `localIP` The local IP address of your PurpleAir sensor; include only if (A)you have your own, and (B)you want to read it locally instead of over the cloud
- `updateFreq` minimum number of seconds between reads from PurpleAir API (a number - default is 90 seconds)
- `name` Is the name of accessory (required).
- `statsKey` Selects the key from the sensor to report. The sensor reports various time based averages which can be selected. These are: v (real time), v1 (10 minute average), v2 (30 minute average), v3 (1 hour average), v4 (6 hour average), v5 (24 hour average), v6 (1 week average).
- `adjust` Adjust the raw PM2.5 value based on various algorithms. These are: NONE (raw values), EPA, LRAPA and AQANDU.
- `includePM10` Include PM10 measurements in the AQI calculation. The highest AQI calculated from PM2.5 and PM10 will be used to calculate the air quality.
- `verboseLogging` Log all measurements
- `adjustTempF` adjust temperature reading to compensate for internal heating of the device. PurpleLAir suggests a -8F degree adjustment.
- `adjustHum` adjust humidity reading to compensate for internal drying in the device. PurpleAir suggests a +4F degree adjustment.

To find your specific "PURPLE_AIR_STATION_ID" (a string):
1. Use the PurpleAir Map to locate a station (https://www.purpleair.com/map)
1. Open this URL in a new Window or Tab: (https://www.purpleair.com/json)
1. Search for the NAME of the station you found in step A (*using JSONview in Google Chrome makes this a bit easier)*
1. The Station ID is the first element in the results[:] map - you will enter this ID (1-5 digits) into the preferences for the Air Quality Station
    1. If you have an outdoor sensor, there should be 2 entries in the big JSON file, one for each sensor. Please use only the FIRST entry - the code will find the second and average the values, as done for the PurpleAir map.
